#to do list
#add water year type to abundance data (note that invert data categorized by calendar year)
#create map showing all stations, active and historic

#required packages
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(hms)
library(readxl) #importing data from excel files
library(waterYearType) #lists all water year types 1901 - 2017

#read in data--------------------

#separate the taxonomy in the headers from the abundance data
#eventually combine these into one data frame

#first the abundances

#then the taxonomy

#format and combine data sets----------

#glimpse(taxon) #column types look correct

#join abundance and taxonomy data

#explore station data---------------
#almost no stations that cover full time period starting in 1975 to present

stns <- stations %>%

#replace "Present" with current year

#need to decide how to categorize stations in a useful way
#mostly should focus on active stations 
#but there are some historical stations with many years of data



#explore abundance data---------------

#range of dates
range(sp_abund$date) #"1975-05-19 UTC" "2020-10-20 UTC"

#look at stations
unique(sp_abund$station_code) #53 stations

#look at histograms of frequencies by species

#look at histogram of total abundances by species

#look at which species are most abundant in wet years vs Critical years
#also look at Rosie's proposed definitions for multi-year periods of drought vs. wet
#also look at Betsy's manuscript

#create definition for rare taxa and exclude them from data set
