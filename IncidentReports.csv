UPDATE: Black Butte Lake is undergoing a lake-wide cyanobacteria bloom. On May 30, 2019 state officials sampled 4 sites in Black Butte Lake (Buckhorn Day Use Area, Orland Buttes Boat Ramp area, Eagle Pass Recreation Area, and the bowl near the dam/observation point).  All four sites had cyanobacteria present but no toxin was detected by the lab. Recreational users are urged to use caution when recreating at the lake and to practice healthy habits (follow posted signs, rinse off with freshwater after swimming in lake, keep pets out of water and do not let them drink the lake water).   Borrow ponds also have cyanobacteria present but no toxins detected.  Park management has posted USACE algae watch signs at the lake. For more information on site conditions, contact the Black Butte Lake USACE Park Ranger Office at (530) 865-4781.
 
Visual observations confirmed cyanobacteria bloom in several areas around the lake on 5/12/19. USACE standard bloom watch signs were posted.

11/3/20: Signs have been down-graded to Warning Level.
10/30/2020: Red Lake is currently posted with Danger Level Advisories. Based on most recent lab results, CDFW plans to down-grade from Danger to Warning Level the week of 11/02/2020. 
10/29/2020: Results from samples collected by AWG at Red Lake on 10/20/2020 available: Shoreline 1 sample (16.87 ug/L) and Shoreline 2 sample (9.62 ug/L), still fall between the Warning (6 ug/L) and Danger (20 ug/L) Action Trigger Levels. Both Tributary samples are non-detect, and results for the outlet -Red Lake Creek sample(1.62 ug/L) dropped significantly from Sept, but still falls between the Caution and Warning Action Trigger Levels. 

Water Board staff recommend resampling in November.

9/26/2020: CDFW posted Danger signs at both drive-up entrances, on the dam, and a trail leading up to the dam. 

9/25/2020: Alpine County Public Health Officer issued a Public Health Brief 

9/25/20: Microcystins (MC) levels measured at one of two shoreline sites were 2,389.5 ug/L which significantly exceeds the established Danger Level trigger for Human and Animal Health of 20 ug/L. Levels of MC were much lower for a second shoreline sample (17.54 ug/L), but were approaching the Danger Trigger Level. Levels of MC measured in a third sample collected from Red Lake Creek were 4.96 ug/L and approaching the Warning Level trigger (6 ug/L). 
Additional samples were collected from two tributaries draining into the lake, but cyanotoxin analysis was not performed because only diatoms, no cyanobacteria cells, were observed with microscopy identification.
Danger signs recommended and will be posted by Dept. of Fish and Wildlife on 9/26.


8/27/20: At two of the sample locations cyanobacteria was not observed. The other three locations contained non-detectable amounts of anatoxin-a and cylindrospermopsin. These three locations detected low amounts of microcystin, but all were below the Caution Trigger Level (0.8 ug/L).

8/5/2020: Results from sampling conducted by AWG  on 07/28/2020 indicate the following: Microscopy results for one shoreline sample indicated the presence of Microcystis sp. And Dolichospermum. Microscopy results for the Red Lake Creek sample showed the presence of low amount of Microcystis. Toxin analysis (ELISA method) performed on the Red Lake Creek sample indicated microcystin at 3.85 ug/L.
Since this toxin level falls within the Caution Level Advisory Level range, Water Board staff requested CDFW post Caution Level Advisories.  An additional shoreline sample detected microcystin at 0.21 ug/L, which is I below the 0.8 ug/L Caution Action Trigger.  

CDFW will be posting Caution Level Advisories signs on Friday, Aug. 7. 


6/24/2020:  Results from 06/16/2020 Sampling Event- Microscopy identification of the Red Lake samples (shoreline, tributaries, and outlet creek) indicated the presence of potentially toxigenic cyanobacteria Dolichospermum sp. In all samples but the 633RLTR01 (Red Lake Tributary 1) sample. Analysis to quantify total toxin producing cyanobacteria by toxin class using qPCR methods did not indicate the presence of any toxin producing gene copies. As such, cyanotoxin analysis was not performed on the water samples. 

CDFW staff were notified  of the results in the event that the information may be used to inform fish stocking or other CDFW activities at Red Lake.
